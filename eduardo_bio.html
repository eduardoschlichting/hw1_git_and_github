	<h1>Hi! My name is Eduardo Schlichting!</h1>

	<h2>Ok Eduardo, but WHO TF are you?</h2>

	<p>I'm Brazilian, 20 years old, and I'm currently living in London, Ontario, Canada!</p>

<p>To tell a bit about myself: before I came here, I lived in a small town called Bundoran, in Ireland, for almost 2 years.<br>There I did a language exchange program so I could learn English a bit better :D. I studied Graphic Design for 2 years in Recife, Brazil.<br>Since then, I've worked with a variety of clients from Brazil and even from other countries, as Ireland and the USA.<br> I'm focused in Brand Design but I love Motion Graphics; in the past year I started to do some experimental jobs in UI/UX Design<br>and Web Design, and it was there that I discovered a new passion haha.So now, I'm Studing Interactive Media Design at Fanshawe!</p>

<p>To be a bit more personal, I'm passionate by dogs and cats! I have 2 dogs, a "sausage dog" called Willy Wonka and<br>a Hottweiler called Hot! I also have a black cat called Gatinha (little cat, in english. And yeah, we're super creative with names at<br>my house haha). To be fair Hot and Willy are from my brother, but I lived for so long with them that I consider them being mine too haha.<br>I love spend my free time playing games, listening to music and travelling (oh gosh I miss travelling so much, DAMN pandemic!!).<br>There's probably more stuff but I can't remember right now, my memory is terrible.</p>

<p><b>And That's me!</b></p>
