		<b><h2>About me</h2></b>
		<p>I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil. The year was 1991 and the day was... Keanu Reeve's birthday (so I hope it's a holiday in Canada and therefore you know the date by heart). I have two siblings, my brother Renan is the first born, my sister Renata came two years later and then me, the best trial after those two drafts, haha. Now I'm living in London, Canada, and my sister is my neighbor.</p> 

		<p>I have a degree in Journalism and post-graduation diploma in Communication and Social Media Advisory. Although my goal now is to become a web designer, I am still open-minded about my future after I get my diploma. I believe that the coding part will be very hard to learn so I hope to get it right. As a Disney fan I get curious about the Motion Design course, but it’s hard to imagine working on this area considering my drawing skill is the same as a four-year-old kid. We had a assignment from Justin to draw I tattoo and I did the Stitch. Let's say if someone wakes up with that on their body it would be while in a huge hangeover.</p>

		<i><p>Short moments of little baby Ra  </p></i>
		<!-- This video is some of my first moments in record. The VHS-mp4 converter made them P&B, I am not that old to be like silent films. About the tag, I read somewhere that now only requires the MP4 but when I tried it didn't work. Luckly it worked without OGG.-->

		<b><h2>Things that I like</h2></b>
		<ul>
			<li>To write, it’s my favorite way to express and communicate with people, even more because I'm shy.</li>
			<br>

			<li>I’m a bit eclectic about music taste, but I believe we can say that my favorites are Queen and Ed Sheeran.</li>
			<br>

			<li>There’s a few movies that once I find it on TV I always stop to watch, such as Pride and Prejudice and the Harry Potter saga. I’m a Disney fanatic, so there’s lots of animations that I can watch as many times as I can, like Coco, Aladdin and Mulan.</li>
			<br>

			<li>I love the ironic and unsociable charisma of the lead character from House M.D. I think it was creative to have a doctor like that as the lead of a series television and this series was one of the few that knew when to stop. I also can’t forget to mention Friends, I watched too many times and it’s what I always choose to play when I just want something to be on the background of my daily chores.</li>
			<br>

			<li>Since 2008 I also like to watch and read some entertainment from Japan and South Korea, such as mangas, animes and doramas. Unlike the recent trend, I'm not so into their songs. </li>
			<br>

			<li>It may feel cliche but I'd love to travel more. However, considering this pandemic scenario, seems like I travelled more that I should: I had a two-day trip to Colombia to get the fingerprint process I needed for my Visa and then I moved from Brazil to Canada. It's hard to choose a favorite trip, so I'll just state that the best will be my next, once everybody is vaccinated and "back to normal". </li>
		</ul>

		<i><p>So no one told you life was gonna be this way?  </p></i>

		<h2>About my name</h2>
		<p> My parents, Rose and Roberto, decided to have 3 children named with the same first letter. One day, in a magazine, they saw a name in an article. They named me after <i>Raisa Gorbachyova</i> (in portuguese her first name is written as Raissa). She was the wife of soviet leader <i>Mikhail Gorbachev</i>. but my parents just wanted a name with R and liked hers, there’s no tribute intended.</p>

		<p>In my birth certificate it's written Raíssa, but that's the only document that uses this accentuation so I don't bother much on how people write this part. In the brazilian pronunciation, when R begins a word, it sounds like H like in how, here, heat, home. So, originally, my name begins with that strong sound, but I really don't mind, if it's easier for you, you can call me Shakira - wherever, whenever.</p>

		<p>Figueiredo isn't a middle name. It's not unusual in Brazil to name someone with a surname from the father side and other from the mother side. So here I am, Raissa Figueiredo Prado, usually just Raissa Prado. But if you read until here, you can call me Raissa or Ra.</p>
